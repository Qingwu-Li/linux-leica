Altera FPGA/HPS Bridge Driver

Required properties:
- compatible	: Should contain one of:
		  "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge",
		  "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge", or
		  "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge"
- reset-names	: Should contain one of:
		  "lwhps2fpga",
		  "hps2fpga", or
		  "fpga2hps"
- resets	: Phandle and reset specifier for the reset listed in
		  reset-names
- clocks	: Clocks used by this module.

Optional properties:
- bridge-enable	: 0 if driver should disable bridge at startup.
		  1 if driver should enable bridge at startup.
		  Default is to leave bridge in its current state.

Example:
	hps_fpgabridge0: fpgabridge@0 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge";
		resets = <&rst LWHPS2FPGA_RESET>;
		reset-names = "lwhps2fpga";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
		bridge-enable = <0>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge1: fpgabridge@1 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge";
		resets = <&rst HPS2FPGA_RESET>;
		reset-names = "hps2fpga";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
		bridge-enable = <1>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge2: fpgabridge@2 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge";
		resets = <&rst FPGA2HPS_RESET>;
		reset-names = "fpga2hps";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
	};
